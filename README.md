# 📊 Fitbit Dataset Statistical Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This statistics assignment analyzes data collected from **Fitbit wearable devices** to explore patterns in physical activity and health-related behaviors. The project focuses on using **statistical methods and visual representations** to extract meaningful insights from real-world data.

The analysis emphasizes clear data interpretation through charts and graphs, making complex statistical findings easy to understand.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze Fitbit data using descriptive and inferential statistics
* Identify trends and relationships in activity-related variables
* Present findings using clear and effective data visualizations
* Strengthen practical understanding of statistics using real-world datasets

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset consists of anonymized Fitbit records, which may include:

* 🏃 **Daily steps**
* 🔥 **Calories burned**
* ⏱️ **Active minutes** (light, moderate, vigorous)
* 😴 **Sleep duration and quality**

> *Note: All data used is for academic purposes only.*

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* 📈 **Statistical Tools**: Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
* 📊 **Visualization Methods**: Bar charts, line graphs, histograms, scatter plots
* 💻 **Software**: Microsoft Excel / R / Python (depending on implementation)

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning** 🧹
   Removed missing or inconsistent values to ensure accurate analysis.

2. **Statistical Analysis** 🧠
   Applied appropriate statistical techniques to summarize and interpret the data.

3. **Data Visualization** 🎨
   Created visual representations to highlight trends, comparisons, and distributions.

4. **Interpretation** 📝
   Explained results in simple terms supported by visuals.

## 🖼️ Visual Representations

The following visualizations were used to support the analysis:

* 📊 Bar charts to compare activity levels
* 📈 Line graphs to observe trends over time
* 🔵 Scatter plots to identify relationships between variables
* 🧮 Histograms to analyze data distribution

*(Insert screenshots or figures here)*

## 🔍 Key Findings

* Clear trends were observed in daily activity patterns
* Visualizations helped reveal relationships between steps, calories, and active minutes
* Statistical summaries supported conclusions drawn from the graphs

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

Through this assignment, the following skills were developed:

* Practical application of statistical concepts
* Data-driven reasoning and interpretation
* Effective visual communication of numerical data

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Incorporate inferential statistical tests (e.g. correlation, regression)
* Compare multiple users or time periods
* Use interactive dashboards for enhanced visualization
